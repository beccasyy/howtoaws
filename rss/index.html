Many are looking to start investing because you understand the importance of it or simply, because of peer influence and the idea of not wanting to lose out.</p><p>Taking the first step can seem really daunting, especially when it involves hard-earned money. Being a young adult myself, I can understand your fears. I have encountered many friends and family members who are too afraid to invest, afraid that they might be &quot;burned&quot; from investing. I hope this article can convince you to take the first baby step in your investing journey.</p><h3 id="1-inflation-kills-your-cash">1. Inflation kills your cash</h3><p>As time passes, your purchasing power decreases. For example, an apple today cost about a dollar and ten years later, it may cost 3 dollars.</p><p>You should have noticed that the same amount of food that you bought last time cost way more now. Or they serve you a smaller portion for the same price.</p><p>Investing ensures that you would be able to &quot;beat&quot; inflation and that your assets/cash value will not decrease over time but instead increase!</p><h3 id="2-more-money-for-your-future-self">2. More money for your future self</h3><p>It could be for your retirement, your next vacation or even your children&apos;s education. Who wouldn&apos;t want more money?</p><h3 id="3-earn-while-you-sleep">3. Earn while you sleep</h3><p>This could be by far the biggest reason why one should invest. As humans, we are simply limited by our working hours. Effectively, it should be around 8 hours if you work from 9 am to 5pm.</p><p>Through investing, you will be happy to know that regardless of whether you are working or sleeping, your money is working hard for you instead of depreciating.</p><h3 id="4-invest-in-areas-that-you-want-to-see-changes-in">4. Invest in areas that you want to see changes in</h3><p>Climate change is real. As a young adult living in the tropics, I am experiencing terrible weather, with temperatures being unbearably high. It will likely be worse in the future. Personally, I make it a point to invest in companies that help the world in transitioning to using sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind and even hydro.</p><p></p><p>These are 4 reasons on why you should invest! The reasons seem really simple but are in fact, important factors to remember. The first step is always the hardest to take, so I hope you take a leap of faith and start your journey into achieving your financial goals.</p><p>Do keep a look out for upcoming financial related articles as this article marks the start of my writing journey on financial related topics.</p><p></p><p><em>Photo Used: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jamie452">Jamie Street</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/ ">Unsplash</a> </em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[AWS Lambda Python Hash Producing Different Results]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here is a short and sweet guide on what to do if your Python Hash is producing different results!]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/aws-lambda-python-hash-produce-different-results/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6110eb64f170170ab7c05419</guid><category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cloud]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rebecca]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 08:46:34 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/Hash-Zappa-Article.jpeg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/Hash-Zappa-Article.jpeg" alt="AWS Lambda Python Hash Producing Different Results"><p></p><p>When I deployed my <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">Flask</a> web application to AWS using <a href="https://github.com/Miserlou/flask-zappa">Zappa</a>, I discovered that users could not log in.</p><p>After reading the logs, I realised that the checksums generated whenever a user logs in, were different despite the constant variables (username and user ID).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-python">user_name = &apos;jake&apos;
user_id = &apos;1001&apos;

For each request to the site, API Gateway sends the request to a Lambda worker. The worker could be a different worker that handled the previous request and, as such, has a different random seed generated at startup.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/api-gateway-lambda.png" class="kg-image" alt="AWS Lambda Python Hash Producing Different Results" loading="lazy" width="1282" height="562" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/api-gateway-lambda.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/api-gateway-lambda.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/api-gateway-lambda.png 1282w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>How did I overcome this?</p><p>I cannot force all requests to be routed to a single Lambda worker (this will result in a bottleneck and affect the scalability). Moreover, all Lambda workers are ephemeral, meaning that they last for a short period of time and dies when they are no more requests.</p><p>A quick and easy way is to change the hash function. Instead of using the native hash function, you can utilise the <em>hashlib</em> library to generate a md5 hash. Regardless of where you run this code, you will always generate the same hashed results.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-Python">import hashlib

user_name = &apos;jake&apos;
user_id = &apos;1001&apos;

checksum = hashlib.md5((user_name + user_id).encode(&apos;utf-8&apos;)).hexdigest()

print(checksum)
